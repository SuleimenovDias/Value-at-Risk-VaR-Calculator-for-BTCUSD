# Value-at-Risk-VaR-Calculator-for-BTCUSD
Bitcoin is one of the most volatile assets in the world, making it a great example to test risk models. The project compares how different VaR methods capture this risk, and whether assuming normality (parametric / Monte Carlo) underestimates tail risk compared to real market data (historical method).

Methods
1. Historical Simulation
Uses actual daily returns from BTC-USD. VaR is the empirical quantile of returns (e.g., 5% worst days).
2. Parametric (Varianceâ€“Covariance)
Assumes returns are normally distributed. VaR is computed using the mean, volatility, and normal distribution quantiles.
3. Monte Carlo Simulation
Generates thousands of random returns from a normal distribution with estimated mean & volatility. VaR is estimated from the simulated distribution.
